Standing on the shore waiting for the sunrise
You got that fiery look in your eyes
Smile at me and say what's on your mind
Oh I say I love u like that

Oh yes I love u like that
Oh yeah I love u like that
Oh yes I love u like that

Now we're rolling in the sage
As the tide hits our thighs
Macarena with me under this light
Hold on to me tight

Oh yeah I love u like that
Oh yes I love u like that
Oh yeah I love u like that
Oh yes I love u like that

(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
